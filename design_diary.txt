For this project I thought I would attempt to create a bot for twitter that would be able to like and retweet post from authorized twitter pages, tweet out pre-arranged tweets from a google spreadsheet, and respond to tweets that mentions us and includes # for some game with that games appropriate twitter page. The information to do most of this was available from reliable sources, but the real challenge was when it came to cleaning up the code and then having it pull info from the tweets and checking if what I have in allowed games is in any of those tweets. If I could say anything to a past Mikey that would be of use it would be to not be afraid to make some changes to your already working code to see if you can have a function work the way you want it to. I was nervous about messing up my code so much even though I had already stored the previous version here on github. Another issue that I tackled was when it came to putting my bot on a cloud service to run more frequently, pythonanywhere.com, and all the things I had to interact with on there. The way I had my folders set up on my machine and the way it was set up on there was completely different and I even had to change the code so that it could properly locate the files. I think that the stem of that issue though is the fact that I've never used that website before and I don't have an issue with it, but other people have recommended heroku so that may be a future idea right there. Overall though this project was really exciting because I felt like this bot was more alive then my other projects. All of the other ones were way more useful and more applicable to job related stuff, but just something about making this little bot made me feel like I was just that random programmer at home who makes something on the side that is just for fun and has no real purpose other than just being there.
