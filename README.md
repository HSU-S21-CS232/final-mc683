# Twitter Bot
This is going to be a twitter bot that will post video game related pictures and hopefully
video game related things that aren't just pictures.

```
pip install tweepy
pip install gspread

# Getting Started
If you are starting from scratch then know that there is a bit of a process that you must
undertake in order to get this going. You'll have to make your bot twitter account, go
to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new to create the bot. You will also be required to apply
for a developer account with the bot twitter you created and for me that took a day.
Once that is all squared away if you go to the above link again then you can go ahead 
and fill in the details for your bot and once created you will get the Consumer Key,
 Consumer Secret, Auth Key, and the Auth Secret.

 Now that you have access to those keys and secrets you can go ahead and run the setup
  script and you will be prompted for that information, but once that is all done then
  it should be good to go. Have fun :D !
